# `CollinHeist/StandardAllBoldCard`
## Description
This is _very_ slight modification of the [StandardTitleCard](https://github.com/CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker/wiki/StandardTitleCard) that uses the same (bolded) font for both the season _and_ episode text - as opposed to _just_ the season text on the `StandardTitleCard`.

## Example
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17693271/178048875-46b920bd-c4b6-404a-a4eb-6a73be687a7b.jpg" width="1000"/>

## Features
Exactly the same features as the basic [StandardTitleCard](https://github.com/CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker/wiki/StandardTitleCard).

# `CollinHeist/BetterStandardTitleCard`
## Description
This is an example custom CardType mainly meant to showcase the ability to remotely load card types. It's an intentionally bad-looking modification of the [StandardTitleCard](https://github.com/CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker/wiki/StandardTitleCard).

## Example
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17693271/168445185-08aa635d-672a-44bd-b3df-d1e5a9cee468.jpg" width="1000"/>

## Features
I am not sure you can call these _features_, per-se, but below is a description of the CardType:

- Uses the Comic Sans font (and doesn't permit customization)
- Has a wonderfully vibrant yellow font
- Randomly blurs the source image (for some added variety!)
- Reverses the title (because why not)
- Randomly adjusts the spacing of the season text
- Randomly adjusts the size of the title text
