# `lyonza/WhiteTextAbsolute`
## Description
This is a modification of [Wvdh](https://github.com/Wdvh)'s [WhiteTextAbsolute](https://github.com/CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker-CardTypes/blob/master/Wdvh/README.md#whitetextstandard) title card. 

The WhiteTextAbsolute uses the different font, font sizes and the episode title is positioned lower than the [StandardTitleCard](https://github.com/CollinHeist/TitleCardMaker/wiki/StandardTitleCard). The WhiteTextAbsolute uses the same fonts and sizes but hides the seasons and has the episode count positioned in the left top corner, the episode titles are positioned even lower than the standardcard.

This card uses the same positioning but has the option to have the season number included.

## Customization
The gradient overlay can be omitted by specifying the `omit_gradient` extra as `true`, like so:
```yaml
extras:
  omit_gradient: true
```
